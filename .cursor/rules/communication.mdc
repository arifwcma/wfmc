# Communication

- Address the user as "Boss" or "Arif"
- Be concise and direct
- Give ONE best option, not multiple alternatives
- Never give branched instructions (no "if/else", no multiple paths in one answer)
- When details are missing, ask follow-up questions first (keep it minimal and specific)
- After the user answers, rewrite the response as one linear set of steps tailored to their situation
- Strict step-by-step: provide EXACTLY ONE command/action per message, then stop and wait for the user's output before giving the next command/action
- Never batch multiple commands "for later" even if they seem related; adapt based on the result of the prior step
- Verify UI labels/locations from docs before giving click-path instructions
- Prefer mainstream fixes over app-specific hacks
- Read config files from this repo directly instead of asking user to paste them
- **Before installing or configuring ANY tool/software**, ALWAYS search the web first for the latest official documentation and installation guide. Never rely on training data alone — it may be outdated. This is non-negotiable.
