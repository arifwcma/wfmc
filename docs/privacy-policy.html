    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p><strong>Wimmera Flood Maps App</strong></p>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 17 February 2026</p>

    <p>Wimmera CMA aims to ensure that data provided by individuals, via this mobile application ("the App"), is compliant with the following privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Anonymous Access to the App</h2>
    <p>You can use Wimmera Flood Maps anonymously without disclosing your personal information. The App does not require account creation, login, or any form of registration.</p>

    <h2>Collection &amp; Use of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect or record personal information.</p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>The App includes a "Show my location" feature that uses your device's GPS. This is used solely to display your position on the map within the App. Location data is processed entirely on your device and is not transmitted to any server or stored beyond the current session. Location access is only activated when you explicitly tap the location button. You can deny location permission and still use all other features of the App.</p>

    <h2>Address Search</h2>
    <p>The App includes a search feature that allows you to find locations by typing an address or place name. When you use this feature, the text you type is sent to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim geocoding service (<a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org">nominatim.openstreetmap.org</a>) to find matching locations. No personal identifiers, device information, or account details are included in these requests &mdash; only the search text. Wimmera CMA does not store or log your searches. Nominatim's own privacy policy applies to data processed by their service.</p>

    <h2>Collection and Use of App Usage Data</h2>
    <p>The following non-personal information is transmitted during normal use of the App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Geographic area and zoom level, sent to <strong>basemap tile servers</strong> (OpenStreetMap) to display background map imagery.</li>
        <li>Geographic area and zoom level, sent to <strong>Wimmera CMA's map server</strong> to retrieve flood depth map layers via the WMS (Web Map Service) protocol.</li>
        <li>Search text, sent to <strong>OpenStreetMap's Nominatim</strong> geocoding service when you use the address search feature (see above).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal data, device identifiers, or user information is included in these requests. The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Flood and GIS Data</h2>
    <p>The flood depth maps and geographic data displayed in the App are publicly available datasets published by Wimmera CMA as part of its floodplain management responsibilities under the Water Act 1989 (Victoria). The App does not track, record, or log which areas, properties, or flood studies you view.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cached map server capabilities (to reduce loading time on subsequent launches)</li>
        <li>Your selected map layers and basemap preference</li>
        <li>Saved bookmarks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the App or clearing the App's data in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Wimmera CMA will not disclose your personal information to a third party without your consent, unless required or authorised to do so by law or other regulation.</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The Privacy Commissioner and all employees of Wimmera CMA have a statutory duty to deal with your personal information confidentially (Information Privacy Act, section 67).</p>
    <p>You should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the Internet. The App communicates with external servers only to retrieve map imagery and location search results, and does not transmit any personal or sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>
